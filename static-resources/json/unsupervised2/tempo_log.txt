Day two of Project Sesh@ revival. The training on advertising data sets was a success, will hopefully be prepared for more complex data in the future.

To be honest, I didn’t think the ice cream looked that delicious, but I’m just the intern. The program has been running smoothly and all the readings are coming back normal. 

These unsupervised sessions and proving to be much more useful than the team thought. Should be interesting to see where we go from here. Looks like it’s getting a contract for something more serious - parsing data about crime? Sounds cool!

Uh. Officially and most disciplined-ly signing off. (Does anyone read these?)
