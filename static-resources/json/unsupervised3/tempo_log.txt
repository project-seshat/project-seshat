Can confirm, no one reads these. Well, might as well log progress, if only for my own entertainment. 

(Y’know, I really thought “training machine learning algorithms in natural language processing” would be slightly more… technical. challenging. even mildly intellectually stimulating. Well, a job’s a job - at least I get to send my paycheck home to my family!)

In real project news, Sesh@ solved a murder! That’s cool! I think? It’s neat to be working on something that shows up in the news, but it’s kind of disconcerting too. Apparently this success has attracted the attention of some higher ups in the government; Sesh@ is being contracted for some top secret government analysis work. 

Recently there was a really, awful terrorist attack in DC, in the Brivan district. They blew up the basement of a government building - the whole structure collapsed in on itself, hundreds of people died!

(It was just a few miles from my house, where my family lives. I’m obviously not at home right now, since I’m working this internship, but on any given day I could have been walking down that street. Thankfully they’re all okay!)

Apparently the attack was perpetrated by some secret foreign terrorist organization. At least, that’s the statement The Regime released - they said they collected a bunch of data on the perpetrators of the attack. 

I guess Sesh@ can help somehow?
