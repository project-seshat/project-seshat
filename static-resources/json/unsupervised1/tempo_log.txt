Today marks day one of the Project Sesh@ revival. The only tests done were for basic calibration purposes. Food, people, simple things.

I’ll be responsible for overseeing the unsupervised training sessions. The goal is to have the program learn natural language processing. By allowing Sesh@ to explore an array of different data sets, we hope to get the program to be able to choose correctly amongst increasingly diverse situations. 

Content for these sessions will be news articles, office memos, and Workflo messages from within Qualia. Oh, and I guess these logs. Pretty much anything written here at the office is just going to be blindly passed to Sesh@. I would know - I’m the one doing the blind passing.
