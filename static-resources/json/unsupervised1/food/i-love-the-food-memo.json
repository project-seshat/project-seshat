Bunch of complainers I swear.\nOn that note, has anyone tried to Health First program at Qualia? I heard there's some really good benefits. Papayeggs? Yum. You can't get that kind of stuff anymore. It's too hard to find in this day and age. I love the way we are treated here. It's so amazing.\nSincerely and Unsarcastically,\nJohn Walker"
