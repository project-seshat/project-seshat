	"text" : "Hello, dining staff of Qualia. I hope you have been having a productive and fruitful day.\nIt has come to my attention that reviews of the culinary experience at Qualia are at an all time low. Reviews of your food have been qualified as “cardboard” or “better than prison, I guess”, by various employees. In my own experience, I tried the “meaty surprise!” you served last Tuesday. It was awful.\nThis is not satisfactory. We at Qualia believe in a collective mission and goal of helping our people thrive and succeed. Without this, how can we expect ourselves to be any better than those that try to prevent us from achievement? How will our employees work at their highest potential if they can’t enjoy a luxury experience?\nThus, I am issuing a stern warning to staff. Should you not improve your food quality within the next two weeks, I will be forced to take action. This could range anywhere from temporary suspension to being included in The Sorting. Please do not let your fellow employees down. We expect the best of you.\nBest,\nCathal Stone"
