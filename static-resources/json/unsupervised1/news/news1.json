    "text" : "In recent years, global food processing company Blob-O’s Unlimited has been expanding their reach. These days you can find a Blob-O’s fast food chain on nearly every street corner as well as their marketplaces where you can find their hand-crafted ingredients to some of their most popular dishes. This new ubiquity must make us pause and ask the question: has this changed Blob-O’s quality irreversibly? When I bite into a Blob-O Burger these days, I don’t know if it’s as juicy and tasty as the ones my great-grandfather grew up on. I’m worried that they’re stretching themselves too thin. I’m worried that our children will live in a world where Blob-O’s doesn’t have that personal touch. Even now, they’re using artificial intelligence technology to determine what is the most appetizing food. What’s a robot going to know about tastiness? I’m worried Blob-O’s. Very Worried.",
