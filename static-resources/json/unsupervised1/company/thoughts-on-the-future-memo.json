I'm afraid that we are going too far. I went in the field to do some user research, and I was shocked to see how liberally our classifications were becoming. Some of these people had families. Some of these people were good people. I don't know how I feel about this anymore. What if we are doing something wrong? Then What?\nPlease, keep this a secret between us. I don't know who else to talk to. If this got out, I could be in a lot of trouble."
